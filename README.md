# SNIP-pytorch
Evaluate sensitivity of channel/vector connection to decrease width/depth of network. Which will accelerate inference speed and reduce storage without any other modules or sparse multiplications

  - [Another pytorch implementation of SNIP](https://github.com/mi-lad/snip)
   - I refered forward overriding and getting mask parts(snip.py), nice implementation!
